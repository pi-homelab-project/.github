# Pi Homelab Project

![Pi Homelab Project Logo](resources/pi-homelab_v3_transparent.png)

This project is intended to be a collaborative space for [@messedpRyan](https://github.com/messedupryan) and \@whateverTomsNameIs. This project will contain resources related to using Raspberry Pi devices to host a kubernetes cluster running k3s. It will also contain a Jenkins Pipeline Library and various apps that we are running on our cluster. The primary goal if the project is learning.

## Tech Stack
- Raspberry Pi running [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/)
- [k3s](https://k3s.io/) kubernetes cluster
    - [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) for inbound traffic
    - [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) for the build pipeline
    - [docker-registry](https://github.com/twuni/docker-registry.helm) for a private docker registry
